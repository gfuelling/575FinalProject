		<div id= "sidePanel">According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, 90% of US adults use the internet as of 2019, compared to early 2000, when only half of all adults were online.  The internet has changed our habits in many areas of life, particularly social and professional connections, communication, work, shopping, and research.  In addition, the internet is widely used by both employers in recruitment and selection processes and by job seekers looking for opportunities.<br /><br />Several factors are known to impact the rate internet use, such as income, education, and community type. The internet increases the efficiency of information search and exchange, but those who do not have access to the internet may be at a distinct disadvantage, particularly when searching for employment.  By identifying geographic locations with lower than average internet access numbers, intentional strategies for employment outreach can be developed for a targeted area.
